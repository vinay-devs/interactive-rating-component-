## Overview
An interactive rating component is a user interface element that allows users to rate items or services on a scale, such as 1 to 5 stars.
The use of interactive rating components can enhance user engagement and provide valuable feedback for the item or service being rated.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
